# Hypatia.jl

Under construction. Only works on Julia master.

An interior point solver for general convex conic optimization problems. An extension of methods in [CVXOPT](https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/blob/master/src/python/coneprog.py) and [Alfonso](https://github.com/dpapp-github/alfonso).

Solves a pair of primal and dual cone programs:

primal (over x,s):
```
  min  c'x :          duals
    b - Ax == 0       (y)
    h - Gx == s in K  (z)
```
dual (over z,y):
```
  max  -b'y - h'z :      duals
    c + A'y + G'z == 0   (x)
                z in K*  (s)
```
where K is a convex cone defined as a Cartesian product of recognized primitive cones, and K* is its dual cone.

The primal-dual optimality conditions are:
```
         b - Ax == 0
         h - Gx == s
  c + A'y + G'z == 0
            s'z == 0
              s in K
              z in K*
```

### Example with Pardiso

```julia
import Hypatia
const SO = Hypatia.Solvers
include("test/native.jl")

ENV["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = length(Sys.cpu_info())
import Pardiso

orthant1(Float64, solver = SO.Solver{Float64}(system_solver = SO.NaiveElimSparseSystemSolver{Float64}(fact_cache = Hypatia.PardisoNonSymCache())))
```
